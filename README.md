A simple Java program that stores and manages a sailing club’s fleet of boats.
The program loads boat data from a CSV file on the first run, then saves and reloads the fleet from a .db file on later runs. Users can view the fleet, add boats, remove boats, and request to spend money on maintenance (as long as the expenses do not exceed the original purchase price).
